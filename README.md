## Research
My research at the [ROAM Lab](https://roam.me.columbia.edu/) under [Matei Ciocarlie](https://roam.me.columbia.edu/people/matei-ciocarlie) focused on a mix of Tactile and Force Sensing, Robotic Manipulation and Control based on Tactile Data, and Data-Driven Neural Networks to empower physical sensors. My previous research under [Hod Lipson](https://www.me.columbia.edu/faculty/hod-lipson) was on Evolutionary Robotics and developing CUDA based simulations for better testing of robots.

**Compact LED-Based Displacement Sensing for Robot Fingers**
I lead the Electronic and Software design on a new 6-Axis Force Torque sensor designed to be placed in the joints of a full sensorized robotic hand. Done in Collaboration with Sharfin Islam (Mechanical Lead) and Pedro Piacenza.

**Time-Series Models for Tactile Sensing**
I worked on expanding the original functionality of the [Disco Fingers](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/about/news/highly-dexterous-robot-hand-can-operate-dark-just-us) by introducing time-series data into the models for better prediction accuracy. Done under the supervision of Eric Chang and Gagan Khandate.

**Evo-devo Simulation**
A year long project to first design both a CUDA based simulation environment for simple spring-mass robots and then to develop algorithms for Evolving Underwater Robots. Done in collaboratino with Dawson Cohen.

## Projects

**Robotic Studio - Centipede Robot**
A one-semester project to build a robot from scracth with minimal guidance. Along with Desmond O'Malley, I designed a concept for a centipede robot, implimented it in Solid Works, assembled the components, and created the drivers and control loop for its movement.
